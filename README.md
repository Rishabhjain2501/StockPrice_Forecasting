# Anomaly Detection in Real-Time Data Streams
Project Overview
This project implements a Python script for detecting anomalies in a continuous data stream. The simulated stream consists of floating-point numbers, which could represent various metrics such as financial transactions or system performance metrics. The aim is to identify unusual patterns, including exceptionally high values and deviations from the norm.

# Objectives

# Data Stream Simulation:
Create a function that emulates a data stream, incorporating regular patterns, seasonal elements, and random noise to mimic real-world scenarios.

# Algorithm Selection:
Implement a suitable anomaly detection algorithm that can adapt to concept drift and seasonal variations in the data.

# Anomaly Detection:
Develop a real-time mechanism that accurately flags anomalies as they occur in the data stream.
